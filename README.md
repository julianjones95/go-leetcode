# Learning Go Using Leetcode

This repository contains solutions to common leetcode problems. This also
contains test cases in case the reader wants to pull the repository and run
their code locally.

## Structure

Below is the learning structure I followed when making this repository. It is
important to note some weeks only contain 1 topic. This is because I found
that understanding of said topic was strategically important for comprehension
of future topics.
